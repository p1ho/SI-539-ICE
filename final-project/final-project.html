<h2>Findings</h2>

<h3>Use the correct HTML element for your content</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>The source code looks it might autogenerated, thus it is very malformed. Running it through validator shows lots of errors. Running it through w3c validator shows lots of errors in xmlns attributes in the html tag.</li>
    <li>In some of the &lt;ul&gt; lists, there is a '|'corrector in between &lt;li&gt; tags; no text content should be allowed between &lt;li&gt; tags within a &lt;ul&gt; tag.</li>
    <li>It looks like some &lt;span&gt; tags in the page actually contain way more elements than what is usually expected of the &lt;span&gt; tag. A &lt;div&gt; or even a &lt;section&gt; would make more sense.</li>
    <li> Some orphan tags exist (like an &lt;/a&gt; without an &lt;a&gt;)</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Support keyboard navigation</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>While there is tabbing between different html elements, some functionalities do not work. For example, hover menu does not expand when it is focused.</li>
    <li>The FAQ does not support keyboard navigation on this page <a href="https://campusinfo.umich.edu/get-questions-answered" target="_blank">https://campusinfo.umich.edu/get-questions-answered</a></li>
    <li>The map page (<a href="https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/" target="_blank">https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/</a>) does not work with keyboard navigation</li>
</ul>    

<h3>Understand and use HTML landmarks</h3>
<p class="pass">Pass</p>
<ul>
    <li>For the most, the html structure is easy to read. It also utilizes html 5 semantic elements such as &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; to divide the page.</li>
    <li>It also utilizes the h1-h6 tags pretty effectively, there is no jump (e.g., skipping h3 to h3)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Write good alt text for your images</h3>
<p class="pass">Pass</p>
<ul>
    <li>All img tags have an alt attribute.</li>
    <li>The alt attributes are meaningful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design focus states to help users navigate and understand where they are</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are definitely places where the focus effect is clear when the element is tabbed on (nav bar), but at least half the time it is not clear which element is actually in focus.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Help users understand inputs, and help them avoid and correct mistakes</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>Even though this is mainly an informational website with minimal form elements, they still exist; and there does not seem to be any measure to help users avoid input mistakes with these form elements (e.g., search bar, map search, Chat with CIC Staff, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use ARIA attributes when applicable</h3>
<p class="pass">Pass</p>
<ul>
    <li>Like mentioned before, this website does not have many form elements, but it does include aria tags wherever applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Give users a way to skip top level navigation to access main content</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>When tabbing it does bring out a visible section that has a link that reads "skip to content", but the link is not navigable through keyboard, it has to be clicked by mouse which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Make links descriptive</h3>
<p class="pass">Pass</p>
<ul>
    <li>The links are all descriptive, no "click here" or other ambiguous wording spotted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Avoid images and iconography in pseudo-elements</h3>
<p class="pass">Pass</p>
<ul>
    <li>The image and icons are all written in html, not through css styling. Well done.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Make SVGs accessible to assistive technology</h3>
<p class="pass">Pass</p>
<ul>
    <li>No SVG spotted, thus not applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hide decorative elements from screen readers</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>Although all imgs have alt tags that are descriptive of picture content, some of then should be hidden when using a screen reader.</li>
    <li>For example, for 'Campus Map, 'Victor Views Blog', 'Happening@Michigan', the background graphics should be hidden to screen readers in my opinion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create alternate routes for users to access information</h3>
<p class="pass">Pass</p>
<ul>
    <li>The site seems well optimized for screen reader for the most part.</li>
    <li>The campus map does not work as well with screen reader, but beacuse it's using Google Map to power it, so it may be quite difficult to accomplish an accessible experience for that.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Links should be visually identifiable and have clear :focus and :active states</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>Links all have :focus/:hover styling, but no :active styling to distinguish it from focus.</li>
    <li>However, not styling active seems to be a common practice, so I'm not sure if this is an actual issue, just making a note here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HTML document should have a language attribute</h3>
<p class="fail">Fail</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most pages have language attributes on the html tag, but it is not there for campus map (<a href="https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/" target="_blank">https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/</a>).</li>
    <li>Should be a simple fix, just make sure the lang attributes are present on all pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ol>
    <li>I suggest finding a way to make the hover menu expand when tabbed on, and make the options inside the menu navigable. This will make the site more navigable by keyboard, and it will tell the screen reader what are the items between those menu items.</li>
    <li>If users are using tab to navigate the page, chances are they want to know where they are more than how the page looks, try to be more obvious with the outlines or styling of focused elements. As it stands, about 50% of the links are not very conspicuous when it comes to :focus styling; perhaps making the blue borders a bit thicker or turn it into a different color for instance</li>
    <li>Find a way to make the "skip to content" tabbable, and maybe include more meaningful sections than just "content". Currently, not only is the "skip to content" not accessible by keyboard, it is not very informative about the different sections on the page.</li>
    <li>The site obviously has awareness for optimizing for screen reader or general accessibility, but just make sure all of the decisions made for accessibility are well informed and tested with potential target audiences.</li>
</ol>
